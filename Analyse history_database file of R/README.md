Maintaining the logs/ proofs for the work done is really important. The applications like RStudio stores the details like the time and respective command executed at that time in a history_database file. It stores the history of commands executed from the start of the application for the first time and updates it regularly with timestamp.

The location of the history_database file would be
C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Local\RStudio-Desktop

We can navigate to this location and find the history_database file and can use this to analyse the number of attempts/code is used for a particular project over time and also can make a note of each command executed.
In this part I am just considering a time frame and commands used for solving my assignment over time, and made a bar graph to represent the part of assignment which consumed more time and commands
